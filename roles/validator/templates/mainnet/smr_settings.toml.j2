[moonshot]
# The maximum number of milliseconds that the timestamp of a proposed block may be
# ahead of a node's local time when it attempts to vote for the block. Validators
# must wait until the timestamp of a certified block has passed before advancing to
# the next round and leaders must wait until the timestamp of the parent block has
# passed before proposing, so this limit prevents Byzantine leaders from forcing
# honest nodes to wait indefinitely by proposing blocks with timestamps that are
# arbitrarily far in the future.

# The number of rounds ahead of self.round for which this node should accept Optimistic Proposals,
# Votes and Timeouts. Must be the same for all nodes. This parameter is helps to limit the amount
# of memory that Byzantine nodes can consume, but the larger it is the more efficient syncing can
# become. This trade-off must be balanced.
